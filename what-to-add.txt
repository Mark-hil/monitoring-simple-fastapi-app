Next steps to level it up for real DevOps tasks:

✅ Add Business Logic or Simulated Workloads Add endpoints that simulate background tasks, queue latency, DB calls, or external API calls to mimic real behavior.

🔥 Add Alerting Rules (Prometheus) Create a rules.yml file for alerts like:

High error rate

High latency

Low availability

Low request throughput

🚨 Add Alertmanager Integrate Alertmanager and configure Prometheus to send alerts. You can get alerts via:

Email

Slack

Webhooks

OpsGenie/PagerDuty (advanced)

📊 Enhance Metrics Add more custom metrics such as:

Queue time (simulate job processing)

Memory/CPU usage via psutil

📦 Dockerize It Containerize the FastAPI app and set up Docker Compose with:

FastAPI

Prometheus

Grafana

Node Exporter

Alertmanager

📁 Organize Project Structure Convert this into a well-structured app with:

/metrics

/alerts

/api/...

health check

✨ Bonus:

Use Celery for async tasks

Simulate load with Locust or k6

Add logging (structured logs)

Add a frontend to visualize metrics as a dashboard (optional)
